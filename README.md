### Our Data
Fortunately for us, the data we needed was quite readily available as CSV files. Portland Trail
Blazers data was gathered from Kaggle [NBA Team Game Stats from 2014 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/nba-games-stats-from-2014-to-2018) (one CSV file)

Portland crime data was pulled directly from the Portland crime bureau website (Police Bureau, n.d.):
[Portland Crime Data](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/71978) (five CSV files from 2015-2019)


### Hypothesis


If a Portland Trailblazers game takes place on a given day, then there will be a decrease in the rate of crime on that day.
